DeathClock is a chess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_control">time control</a> I created in which both players are given a random amount of time within a specified range, and the clock is hidden. This is meant to mimic the situation one finds oneself in in actual life. Happy living and dying 💀
