Live example at: https://deathclock.life

DeathClock is a chess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_control">time control</a> I created in which both players are given a random amount of time within a specified range, and the clock is hidden. This is meant to mimic the situation one finds oneself in in actual life. The live example has a human playing Stockfish with standard rules. Happy living and dying ðŸ’€

For the demo I integrated with code from the <a href="https://chessboardjsx.com/">chessboardjsx</a> stockfish example.
